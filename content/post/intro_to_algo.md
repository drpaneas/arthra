### What you need to know before start reading ...

You will need to be familiar with one programming language at least. If you
don't know any programming langugage, it would be some kind of tricky for you
but not impossible. IMO I'd suggest you to pick up with Python or Ruby, because
they both are pretty easy and famous around these days. However, the code
snippets of this article are written in C.

Additionally, you are expected to know a bit of basic algebra. No no no, I
don't want to scare your or something. Let's take a function: **f(x) = x *
2**. What if (5)? If you answered 10, then you're good to continue reading.


In the early beginning, I found writing posts in markdown format quite tricky.
Things can become quite helpful by using an editor that
comes with features such as **syntax highlighting** and **HTML
monitoring**. Apparently, there are noumerous plugins out there, but for
me, *'vim-instant-markdown'* seems to be sufficient.
